# Tachenrechner
This is a little calculator that can compute basic operation like adding, substracting, dividing and multipliyng.
It also supports the assignment of a litteral variable like "a = 2" and then compute with this variable.
The precedence of the Operators are also respected and the use of parenthesis too.
The use of a space between operand and operator is mandatory, otherwise may the correct functionality of the program not be guarranted.
Example: 1 + 2 + 3 and not 1+2+3
        a = 2 and b = 3 and then a + b
variable assigning works only when an integer value or an another existing variable is assigned to a new variable. It can't store a result of an operation into a variable.
Feel free to test it.
